"""Conversation Branching Demo — explore "what if" scenarios with AgentOS.

This demo shows how to:
1. Start a conversation about investment strategy
2. Branch at a decision point
3. Explore "aggressive" strategy in Branch A
4. Explore "conservative" strategy in Branch B
5. Compare the two paths side-by-side
6. Merge insights from both branches
